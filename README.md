# CS6910-assignment_3

This is the readme file for the 3rd assignment of CS6910 which is based on the use recurrent neural networks to build a transliteration system.

The initial testing and some basic code is in this file https://github.com/CS20M038/CS6910-assignment_3/blob/main/Assignment3_version2_withencoding_and_Multi_Layer_LSTM.ipynb
and this is only for some testing work initially and does not contribute to any questions answer.This is just to show how we approached the final version.

Code for the question 1 to question 4 is in this github link https://github.com/CS20M038/CS6910-assignment_3/blob/main/DL_Assignment_3_Arjun_Version.ipynb
i.e the file named DL_Assignment_3_Arjun_Version.ipynb

The wandb report link for the first part (question 1 to question 4) is https://wandb.ai/theindianwriter/CS6910-Assignment3/reports/Assignment-3-Part-1--Vmlldzo3MTYxNTY

The wandb report link for the second part (question 5 to question 6) is https://wandb.ai/cs20m038/Assignment%203%20Part%202/reports/Assignment-3-Part2--Vmlldzo3MjAzNjQ

The wandb report link for the third part (question 7 to self declaration) is https://wandb.ai/theindianwriter/CS6910-Assignment3/reports/Assignment-3-Part-3--Vmlldzo3MTY5MTg

For Qno 5 and Q6 to run the code change your directory to the directory named "Attention Model", upload all the files it has on github and then run the code "Attention_without_wandB.ipynb" and "Attention_with_wandB.ipynb" .

For the visulation using "Visualization Method 3 using inbuilt functions from open source project"
Install nmtvis to your system using 
pip install nmtvis
Then run the script visulization.py in vs code or your terminal and not on collab. You will be prompted to a webpage where you can the visualization for randomly selected 1000 data points with beautiful animations
